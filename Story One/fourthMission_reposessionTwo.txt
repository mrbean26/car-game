Mechanic: Great! This one's a tricky one...
Mechanic: There's a reckless driver called {civilian 2 name} who's a bit too confident with the accelerate pedal.
Mechanic: He's currently driving a yellow sports car, it's all smashed up. See if you can bring it in.

{civilian 2 name}: Not a chance! This works fine!
